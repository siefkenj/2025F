  You are riding the _Lemniscate Coaster_, a roller coaster whose track is laid out in the shape of
  a lemniscate. A car on the coaster can be modeled by $arrow(p)(t)=(20cos t, 20sin 2t)$.

  + Find expressions for the velocity and the acceleration of the roller coaster.
  + Use Desmos to estimate: what is the fastest that the coaster goes? What is the most acceleration
    it experiences?
    #colbreak()
    To make the ride safe for children, the maximum acceleration should not exceed
    $3g approx 29 "m"/"s"^2$. To achieve this, engineers will install breaking pads that slow the
    coaster down by a factor of $k$.

  + Model the slowed-down coaster's position with a new function $arrow(q)(t)$.
  + What should $k$ be to ensure the maximum acceleration is $3g$? (Hint: Use Desmos to estimate!)
