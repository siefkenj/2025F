    Let $arrow(F): RR^2 -> RR^2$ be a vector field. The *curl* of $arrow(F)$ at a point $arrow(p)$,
    written as $"curl"(arrow(F))$ or $nabla times arrow(F)$ is defined as:

    The limit of the (normalized) rotational force a small square at location $arrow(p)$ experiences
    _in the counter-clockwise direction_.

    Let $arrow(F)(x,y)=mat(-y^2; x)$ and let $arrow(p)=(1,2)$.

    + Find $"curl"thin arrow(F) ( arrow(p))$.
    + "$nabla times arrow(F)$" is a mnemonic for curl. We think of
      "$nabla = mat(partial/(partial x); partial/(partial y))$". In $RR^2$, we think of "$times$" as
      a determinant. So
      $
        nabla times arrow(F) = det mat(partial/(partial x), -y^2; partial/(partial y), x).
      $
      What happens when you "compute" this determinant? Does it make mathematical sense? Can you
      figure out how to find the curl from your formula?
